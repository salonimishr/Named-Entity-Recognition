# Named-Entity-Recognition

Named entity recognition (NER) also referred to as entity chunking, extraction, or identification, is the task of identifying and categorizing key information in the text.
An entity (categorizing key information) can be any word or group of words. For this, spaCy is a tool to work on. In this project, I worked on NER on IMDB dataset* . 
Other exploration of spaCy library has also been done.
